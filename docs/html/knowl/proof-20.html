<p>First we show that if \(E\) is one of the \(m\times m\) elementary matrices, then it must assume one of the forms described above. Indeed, since multiplying on the left by \(E\) performs a certain row operation, and since \(E=E\,I_m\text{,}\) we see that \(E\) itself is the result of performing this particular row operation on the \(m\times m\) identity matrix. Thus \(E\)  is one of the three types of matrices described above, obtained by performing an elementary row operation on \(I_m\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Next, we must show that any of the \(m\times m\) matrices \(E\) described above is indeed elementary in the sense of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_elementary_matrix.html" title="Definition 3.4.1">Definition 3.4.1</a>: that is, we must show that multiplying any \(m\times n\) matrix \(A\) on the left by \(E\) performs the relevant row operation on \(A\text{.}\) This is now a direct consequence of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_row_method.html" title="Theorem 3.1.21: Row method of matrix multiplication">Theorem 3.1.21</a>.</p>
<p>For example, take \(E=\underset{c\,r_i}{E}\text{.}\) For \(j\ne i\text{,}\) the \(j\)-th row of \(E\,A\) is given by the \(j\)-th row of \(E\) times \(A\text{.}\) Since the \(j\)-th row of \(E\) in this case has a one in the \(j\)-th entry and zeros elsewhere, the product of this row and \(A\) is just the \(j\)-th row of \(A\text{.}\) Similarly, the \(i\)-th row of \(E\, A\) in this case is \(c\) times the \(i\)-th row of \(A\text{.}\) Thus \(E\) leaves all the rows of \(A\) except for the \(i\)-th one, which is scaled by \(c\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_invertibility_theorem.html#proof-20">in-context</a></span>
