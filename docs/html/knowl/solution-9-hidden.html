<p>(a) Geometrically, each equation in the system represents a line \(\ell_i\colon a_ix+b_iy=c_i\text{.}\) A solution \((x,y)\) to the \(i\)-th equation corresponds to a point on \(\ell_i\text{.}\) Thus a solution \((x,y)\) to the system corresponds to a point lying on <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> of the lines: i.e., a point of intersection of the lines.</p>
<p>(b) First of all to prove the desired “or” statement it suffices to prove that if the number of solutions is greater than 1, then there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
<p>Now suppose there is more than one solution. Then there are at least two different solutions: \(P_1=(x_1,y_1)\) and \(P_2=(x_2,y_2)\text{.}\) Take any of the two lines \(\ell_i, \ell_j\text{.}\) By above the intersection of \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) contains \(P_1\) and \(P_2\text{.}\) But two <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">distinct</em> lines intersect in at most one point. It follows that \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) must be equal. Since \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) were arbitrary, it follows <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> of the lines \(\ell_i\) are in fact the same line \(\ell\text{.}\) But this means the common intersection of the lines is \(\ell\text{,}\) which has infinitely many points. It follows that the system has infinitely many solutions.</p>
<p>(c) We will get 0 solutions if the system includes two different parallel lines: e.g., \(\ell_1\colon x+y=5\) and \(\ell_2\colon x+y=1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We will get exactly one solution when the slopes of each line in the system are distinct.</p>
<p>We will get infinitely many solutions when <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> equations in the system represent the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">same line</em>. This happens when all equations are multiples of one another.</p>
<p>(d) Now each equation in our system defines a plane \(\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i\text{.}\) A solution \((x,y,z)\) to the system corresponds to a point \(P=(x,y,z)\) of intersection of the planes. We recall two facts from Euclidean geometry:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Fact 1.</span></span><p>Given two distinct points, there is a unique line containing both of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Fact 2.</span></span><p>Given any number of distinct planes, they either do not intersect, or intersect in a line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We proceed as in part (b) above: that is show that if there are two distinct solutions to the system, then there are infinitely many solutions. First, for simplicity, we may assume that the equations \(\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i\) define <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">distinct</em> planes; if we have two equations defining the same plane, we can delete one of them and not change the set of solutions to the system.</p>
<p>Now suppose \(P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \(Q=(x_2,y_2,z_2)\) are two distinct solutions to the system. Let \(\ell\) be the unique line containing \(P\) and \(Q\) (Fact 1). I claim that \(\ell\) is precisely the set of solutions to the system. To see this, take any two equations in the system \(\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i\) and \(\mathcal{P}_j\colon a_jx+b_jy+c_iz=d_j\text{.}\) Since the two corresponding planes are distinct, and intersect in at least the points \(P\) and \(Q\text{,}\) they must intersect in a line (Fact 2); since this line contains \(P\) and \(Q\text{,}\) it must be the line \(\ell\) (Fact 1). Thus any two planes in the system intersect in the line \(\ell\text{.}\) From this it follows that: (a) a point satisfying the system must lie in \(\ell\text{;}\) and (b) all points on \(\ell\) satisfy the system (since we have shown that \(\ell\) lies in all the planes). It follows that \(\ell\) is precisely the set of solutions, and hence that there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
