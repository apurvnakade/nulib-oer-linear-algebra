<p>Now suppose \(P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \(Q=(x_2,y_2,z_2)\) are two distinct solutions to the system. Let \(\ell\) be the unique line containing \(P\) and \(Q\) (Fact 1). I claim that \(\ell\) is precisely the set of solutions to the system. To see this, take any two equations in the system \(\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i\) and \(\mathcal{P}_j\colon a_jx+b_jy+c_iz=d_j\text{.}\) Since the two corresponding planes are distinct, and intersect in at least the points \(P\) and \(Q\text{,}\) they must intersect in a line (Fact 2); since this line contains \(P\) and \(Q\text{,}\) it must be the line \(\ell\) (Fact 1). Thus any two planes in the system intersect in the line \(\ell\text{.}\) From this it follows that: (a) a point satisfying the system must lie in \(\ell\text{;}\) and (b) all points on \(\ell\) satisfy the system (since we have shown that \(\ell\) lies in all the planes). It follows that \(\ell\) is precisely the set of solutions, and hence that there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
