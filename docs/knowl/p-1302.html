<p>The definition of linear independence is quite a mouthful! Some clarifying remarks:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>To prove a subset \(S\) of a vector space \(V\) is linearly independent, we must prove an <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">implication</em>:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
c_1\boldv_1+c_2\boldv_2+\cdots +c_r\boldv_r=\boldzero \implies c_1=c_2=\dots=c_r=0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">More often than not you will do so in the direct manner: i.e., assume you have a linear combination equal to the zero vector, then show that all coefficients must be zero.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By the same token, to show a set \(S\) is linearly dependent, we must produce a <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">nontrivial</em> linear combination of elements of \(S\) equal to the zero vector.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It is easy to see that \(S\) is linearly dependent if and only if some element of \(S\) can be written as a linear combination of other elements of \(S\text{:}\) just take the nontrivial linear combination yielding the zero vector, and solve for the vector in this combination with the nonzero coefficient.</p>
<p>This makes precise what it means for a spanning set \(S\) to have redundancies or not.  If \(S\) is linearly dependent, then one of its vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others, and thus can be “thrown out” when computing \(\Span S\text{,}\) the set of all linear combinations of \(S\text{.}\) Conversely, if \(S\) is linearly independent, then no element of \(S\) can be written as a linear combination of the others; throwing any element out would thus result in \(\Span S\) being strictly smaller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If \(\boldzero\in S\text{,}\) then \(S\) is linearly dependent: indeed, we have the nontrivial linear combination \(1\boldzero=\boldzero\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>If \(S=\{\boldv\}\text{,}\) then \(S\) is linearly independent if and only if \(\boldv\ne \boldzero\text{.}\) The previous comment shows why \(\boldv\ne \boldzero\) is a necessary condition. Let's see why it is sufficient.</p>
<p>Suppose \(\boldv\ne\boldzero\text{,}\) and suppose we have \(c\boldv=\boldzero\text{.}\) By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html" title="Theorem 4.1.13: Basic vector space properties">Theorem 4.1.13</a> we have \(c=0\) or \(\boldv=\boldzero\) (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html" title="Theorem 4.1.13: Basic vector space properties">Theorem 4.1.13</a>). Since \(\boldv\ne 0\text{,}\) we conclude \(c=0\text{.}\) This shows that the only linear combination of \(S\) yielding \(\boldzero\) is the trivial one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose \(S=\{\boldv, \boldw\}\) contains exactly two distinct elements. From the last remark, it follows that \(S\) is linearly independent if and only if one of its elements is a scalar multiple of the other.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to decide whether a two-element set is linearly independent. Note however, that the same observation does not apply to larger sets: e.g., \(S=\{(1,1),(1,0), (0,1)\}\) can be shown to be linearly dependent, and yet no element of \(S\) is a scalar multiple of any other element.</p>
