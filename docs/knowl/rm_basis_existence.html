<p>Wouldn't it have been more natural to simply say \(V\) is infinite dimensional if it has an infinite basis? As it turns out this is indeed equivalent to not having a finite basis, but to prove this we need to establish the general fact that we can always find a basis for a given vector space \(V\text{.}\) As intuitive as that claim may sound (i.e., that bases always exist), its proof requires some set theory methods that are not covered in this text. As such we will not include it in our treatment of dimension, and so will have to make do with our slightly awkward definition of infinite-dimensional vector spaces.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_basis_dimension.html#rm_basis_existence">in-context</a></span>
