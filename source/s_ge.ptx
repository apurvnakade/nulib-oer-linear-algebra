  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="s_systems"/> we sketched a procedure for solving a linear system <m>L</m>. That procedure involved applying a sequence of row operations to <m>L</m> to obtain a <q>simpler</q> system <m>L'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will fill out this sketch in the next two sections. Specifically, we will
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
          describe precisely what we mean by a <q>simpler</q> system,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            provide an algorithm (or recipe) that decides exactly what sequence of row operations to apply to obtain this simpler system,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            explain how to find <em>all</em> solutions of the resulting simpler system.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

<p>
    Before we embark on these steps, we introduce a useful bit of notation. As you may have noticed, when performing row operations on a system of equations, we essentially treat the unknowns, as well as the plus and equals symbols, as placeholders; the only things that actually change in a given step are the coefficients in the equations. The <em>augmented matrix associated to a linear system</em> is a formal way of extracting just the information of the coefficients from a linear system.

  <title>Row echelon matrices</title>
 <p>
   Here is our precise formulation of a <q>simple</q> linear system; it is a system whose associated augmented matrix is in <em>row echelon form</em>, as described below.
</p>
<definition xml:id="d_row_echelon">
  <title>Row echelon form</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      A <term>zero row</term> of a matrix, is a row whose entries are all equal to zero; a <term>nonzero row</term> is a row that contains at least one nonzero entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A matrix is in <term>row echelon form</term> if the following conditions hold.
      <dl>
        <li><title>(i)</title>
        <p>
        In any nonzero row the first (i.e., leftmost) nonzero entry is equal to one. A <term>leading one</term> of a matrix is such an entry: i.e., an entry of a row that is equal to one, and that is also the first nonzero entry of that row.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><title>(ii)</title>
    <p> All zero rows are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><title>(iii)</title>
            <p>
              Given any two nonzero rows in the matrix,
              the leading one of the lower row occurs strictly to the right of the leading one of the row above it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        A matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term>
        if in addition to conditions (i)-(iii) it also satisfies the following condition.
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>(iv)</title>
            Any column of the matrix that contains a leading one has zeros elsewhere. In other words, if a column contains a leading one, then that is the only nonzero entry of that column.
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
      A linear system <m>L</m> is in <term>row echelon form</term> (resp. <term>reduced row echelon form</term>) if its augmented matrix is in row echelon form (resp. reduced row echelon form).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In practice to decide whether a matrix is in in (reduced) row echelon form,
    follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First verify whether all zero rows are at the bottom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each nonzero row,
          determine whether the first nonzero entry is a 1, and put a box around it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure your boxes make a staircase pattern.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (For reduced row echelon form only.) Decide whether each column with a box has 0's everywhere else.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    For each matrix decide (a) whether it is in row echelon form, and (b) whether it is in reduced row echelon form.

            Below you find the matrix with leading ones boxed. This matrix fails to be in row echelon form (and hence also reduced row echelon form) for a variety of reasons: the zero rows are not all grouped at the bottom; the first row is nonzero, but does not have a leading one; the leading one of the fourth row is to the left of the leading one of the leading one in the row above it.

        <li>
          <p> Below you find the matrix with leading ones boxed. This matrix is in row echelon form: the zero rows (rows 4 and 5) are grouped at the bottom; each nonzero row has a leading one (boxed in the matrix below); the leading ones step strictly to the right as we move down the rows.

          The matrix is <em>not</em> in reduced row echelon form, as the last column contains a leading one in its third row, and a nonzero entry in its first row.

  We will now describe a systematic procedure, called <em>Gaussian elimination</em>, that allows us to reduce a given linear system <m>L</m> to a system <m>L'</m>in row echelon form.
  In keeping with the foregoing discussion, we will identify a system <m>L</m> with its augmented matrix <m>A</m>. Furthermore, reducing a linear system using elementary operations on equations is now cast as performing <em>elementary row operations</em> on matrices. At the risk of redundancy we now officially translate a number of our former notions regarding reduction of linear systems to the setting of matrices.

  At last we are ready to define Gaussian elimination. In its essence this is simply a procedure, or <em>algorithm</em>, that takes an input matrix <m>A</m> and row reduces it to a matrix <m>B</m> in row echelon form. It is important to note that although we employ Gaussian elimination in this chapter primarily to the end of simplifying and solving linear systems, this is not its only application. Indeed, we will come back to the procedure again and again, in a great variety of contexts and to greatly diverse ends. Gaussian elimination is one of linear algebra's most important tools. We memorialize this here as an official principle.

<p>We will make heavy use of the first two results of <xref ref="th_matrixforms"/>. The proofs of these statements are not difficult, but not especially illuminating. Accordingly we omit them here, and point the interested reader to Robert Beezer's <url href="http://linear.ups.edu/fcla" visual="linear.ups.edu/fcla"><em>A First Course in Linear Algebra </em></url>. (See <url href="http://linear.ups.edu/fcla/section-RREF.html#theorem-REMEF" visual="linear.ups.edu/fcla/section-RREF.html#theorem-REMEF">Theorem REMEF</url>.)
</p>
<p>The third statement of <xref ref="th_matrixforms"/>, that every matrix is row equivalent to a <em>unique</em> matrix in reduced row echelon form, does in fact have an enlightening proof. We will postpone this proof, however, until we have a little more theory at our disposal. (See <xref ref="cor_RRE_uniqueness"/>.) Until then we will conscientiously <em>not</em> make use of this fact when developing any of our further theory.</p>
<example xml:id="s_ge_ex_REFnotunique">
  <title>Row echelon form is not unique</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Show that a matrix <m>A</m> may be row equivalent to two or more matrices in row echelon form.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Take <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 1 \\
      1 \amp 2  \end{bmatrix}</m>. This row reduces to <m>B=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 1  \\
      0 \amp 1  \end{bmatrix}</m> using Gaussian elimination; and it row reduces further to <m>C=\begin{bmatrix}1\amp 0\\ 0\amp 1\end{bmatrix}</m> using Gauss-Jordan elimination. Thus we see that <m>A</m> is row equivalent to two different matrices in row echelon form. (According to <xref ref="th_matrixforms"/>, the matrix <m>C</m> is the only matrix in <em>reduced</em> row echelon that is row equivalent to <m>A</m>.)

In the first Sage cell below you find a recursive implementation of Gaussian elimination in Sage that includes explanatory comments. Evaluate this cell in order to load the <c>row_echelon_form</c> function. The second cell allows you to apply the Gaussian elimination algorithm to a matrix of your choosing. As you can see, the <c>show</c> function provides a nice <latex /> version of the output.

  Sage has its own row reduction method, <c>rref</c>, which transforms a matrix to <em>reduced</em> row echelon form. Let's compare the outputs of these two algorithms.

  A=matrix([[0,0,3],[0,2,5],[0,3,3]])
  B=row_echelon_form(A)
  C=A.rref()

  show(C)
  B is C

  Some further activities:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Modify the <c>row_echelon_form</c> code to make a non-recursive algorithm.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Add <c>show</c> commands to your non-recursive version of <c>row_echelon_form</c> to show steps in the row reduction.
