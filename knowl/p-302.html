<p>Now suppose there is more than one solution. Then there are at least two different solutions: <span class="process-math">\(P_1=(x_1,y_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_2=(x_2,y_2)\text{.}\)</span> Take any of the two lines <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i, \ell_j\text{.}\)</span> By above the intersection of <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell_j\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{.}\)</span> But two <em class="emphasis">distinct</em> lines intersect in at most one point. It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell_j\)</span> must be equal. Since <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell_j\)</span> were arbitrary, it follows <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the lines <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i\)</span> are in fact the same line <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span> But this means the common intersection of the lines is <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{,}\)</span> which has infinitely many points. It follows that the system has infinitely many solutions.</p>
