<p class="continuation">The staircase pattern of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> allows us to solve easily by <em class="emphasis">backwards substitution</em>. In more detail:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Equation 3 in <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(z=2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now substitute <span class="process-math">\(z=2\)</span> into Equation 2 of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(y=4\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, substitute <span class="process-math">\(y=4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z=2\)</span> into Equation 1 of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span>and solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(x=4\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)=(4,4,2)\)</span> is a solution to <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, since at each step we had no choice in the matter (<span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> must be equal to 2, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> then must be equal to 4, etc.), we see that in fact <span class="process-math">\((4,4,2)\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">only</em> solution to <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">Our method for solving a more complicated system, like <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> above, will be to <em class="emphasis">transform</em> it to a simpler system like <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Key point</em>. In order for this method to work, we need to make sure that the transformed system has <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> the same solutions as the original system! To this end we will restrict our permissible transformations to the <em class="emphasis">elementary  operations</em> define below.</p>

<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.8</span><span class="period">.</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">Elementary operations on linear systems.</span>
</h4>
<p>An <dfn class="terminology">elementary operation</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">elementary row operation</dfn>) is one of the three types of operations on linear systems described below.</p>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Scalar multiplication</dt>
<dd><p>Multiply an equation by a <em class="emphasis">nonzero</em> number <span class="process-math">\(c\ne 0\text{:}\)</span> i.e., replace the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th equation <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> of the system with <span class="process-math">\(c\cdot e_i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(c\ne 0\text{.}\)</span> Note: <span class="process-math">\(c\cdot e_i\)</span> is the result of multiplying the left and right sides of equation <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Equation swap</dt>
<dd><p>Swap the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>-th equations of the system, <span class="process-math">\(i\ne j\text{:}\)</span> i.e., replace equation <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> of the system with <span class="process-math">\(e_j\text{,}\)</span> and replace equation <span class="process-math">\(e_j\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(e_i\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Equation addition</dt>
<dd><p>Add a multiple of one equation to another: i.e., replace <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(e_i+ce_j\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
</dl>
<p>The act of transforming a system of equations using elementary operations is called <dfn class="terminology">reduction</dfn> (or <dfn class="terminology">row reduction</dfn>).</p></article><p>After reducing a linear system <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> using elementary operations, we are left with a new system <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span> The systems <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> will generally look very different from one another. Note, however, that the two systems will have the same <em class="emphasis">number</em> of equations, and the same <em class="emphasis">number</em> of variables. More importantly, the two systems will have identical sets of solutions; that is, the set of solutions of the new system <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is identical to the set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(L\text{!}\)</span></p>
<p>To convince ourselves of this last assertion, it suffices to show that the application of any one of these elementary row operations produces a new system <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> with exactly the same set of solutions as <span class="process-math">\(L\text{;}\)</span> if this is so, then performing any finite sequence of elementary row operations must also preserve the set of solutions in this sense. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s_systems_th_rowops.html" title="Theorem 1.1.12: Row equivalence theorem">TheoremÂ 1.1.12</a> will make these claims official. For now let's look at an example.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="s_systems.html#pars-">in-context</a></span>
