<article class="hiddenproof"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h4>
<p>First recall that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> have the same set of solutions (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s_systems_th_rowops.html" title="Theorem 1.1.12: Row equivalence theorem">TheoremÂ 1.1.12</a>). So it suffices to show that the algorithm returns the correct set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Regarding consistency: if the last column of the augmented matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> associated to <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> has a leading one in the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th row, then the corresponding equation in <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
0x_1+0x_2+\cdots 0x_n=1.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Clearly this equation has no solutions, and hence the set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is empty.</p>
<p>Suppose now that the last column of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> does not have a leading one.</p>
<article class="case"><h4 class="heading">Case 1: no free variables.</h4>
<p>Suppose in Step 3 you determine that there are no free variables. Then each of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> has a leading one in it. If follows that for each <span class="process-math">\(1\leq i \leq n\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>-th equation of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> is of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/s_solving_case1eq.html">
\begin{equation}
x_i+c_{i,i+1}x_{i+1}+\cdots c_{i,n}x_n=b_i.\tag{1.3.4}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> does not have a leading one in the last column, it follows that all equations beyond the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th equation are of the form <span class="process-math">\(0x_1+0x_2+\cdots 0x_n=0\text{,}\)</span> and as such may be disregarded since they are satisfied by any choice of the <span class="process-math">\(x_i\text{.}\)</span> The remaining system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> equations in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> unknowns can be solved by back-substitution, yielding a <em class="emphasis">unique</em> solution <span class="process-math">\((x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n)\)</span> of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/s_solving_case1eq.html">
\begin{align*}
x_n \amp =b_n \\
x_{n-1}\amp =b_{n-1}-c_{n-1,n}x_n=b_{n-1}-c_{n-1,n}b_n \\
x_{n-2}\amp = b_{n-2}-c_{n-2,n}x_{n}-c_{n-2,n-1}x_{n-1}\\
\amp =b_{n-2}-c_{n-2,n}b_n-c_{n-2,n-1}(b_{n-1}-c_{n-1,n}b_n)\\
\amp \vdots 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Do not concern yourself overly with the exact formulas. The important point here is that once we know there is a unique assignment of the variables <span class="process-math">\(x_n, x_{n-1},\dots, x_{i+1}\)</span> that satisfies the system, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/s_solving_case1eq.html" title="Equation 1.3.4">(1.3.4)</a> allows us to solve for <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> in terms of the the <span class="process-math">\(x_j\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(j&gt;i\text{.}\)</span> As such working our way up from the last equation, we find there is a unique solution to the system.</p></article><article class="case"><h4 class="heading">Case 2: free variables.</h4>
<p>Suppose now that <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_1}, x_{i_2},\dots , x_{i_r}\)</span> are the leading variables of <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_{j_1}, x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s}\)</span> are the free variables. Again, since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> does not have a leading one in the last column, there are exactly <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> nonzero equations in <span class="process-math">\(L'\text{:}\)</span> one for each leading variable. After bringing any terms involving free variables to the right, the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-th such equation takes the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_{i_k}+c_{k,k+1}x_{i_{k+1}}+\cdots c_{k,r}x_{i_{r}}=d_k-G_k(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">As in the previous case, back-substitution now allows us to solve for each leading variable as a function of the free variables:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x_{i_r}\amp =d_r-G_r(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\\
\amp =F_s(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\\
x_{i_{r-1}}\amp=d_{r-1}-c_{r}x_{i_r}-G_{r-1}(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\\
\amp = d_{r-1}-c_{r}F_r(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})-G_{r-1}(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\\
\amp =F_{r-1}(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\\
\amp \vdots \\
x_1 \amp=F_1(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s}) 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This new system of equations clearly has the same set of solutions as <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> (and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>), since it was obtained from <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> by deleting zero rows of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and using only addition and subtraction operations. Furthermore, it is clear that any assignment of the free variables</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_{j_1}=t_1, x_{j_2}=t_2,\dots, x_{j_s}=t_s

</div>
<p class="continuation">extends uniquely to the solution of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> that further assigns</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_{i_1}=F_1(t_1,t_2,\dots, t_s), x_{i_2}=F_2(t_1,t_2,\dots, t_s), \dots, x_r=F_r(t_1,t_2,\dots, t_s)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The idea behind uniqueness here, is that once you assign values to the free variables, the values of the leading variables are completely determined by the equations <span class="process-math">\(x_{i_k}=F_k(x_{j_1},x_{j_2},\dots, x_{j_s})\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Lastly, we show that every solution of <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> (and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span>) is obtained in this way. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(u=(u_1,u_2,\dots, u_n)\)</span> is a solution. According to the discussion above <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> must be the unique solution to <span class="process-math">\(L'\)</span> corresponding to the free variable assignment</p>
