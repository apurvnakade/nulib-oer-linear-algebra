<p>The definition of linear independence is quite a mouthful! Some clarifying remarks:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>To prove a subset <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is linearly independent, we must prove an <em class="emphasis">implication</em>:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
c_1\boldv_1+c_2\boldv_2+\cdots +c_r\boldv_r=\boldzero \implies c_1=c_2=\dots=c_r=0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">More often than not you will do so in the direct manner: i.e., assume you have a linear combination equal to the zero vector, then show that all coefficients must be zero.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By the same token, to show a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent, we must produce a <em class="emphasis">nontrivial</em> linear combination of elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> equal to the zero vector.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent if and only if some element of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of other elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{:}\)</span> just take the nontrivial linear combination yielding the zero vector, and solve for the vector in this combination with the nonzero coefficient.</p>
<p>This makes precise what it means for a spanning set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to have redundancies or not.  If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent, then one of its vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others, and thus can be “thrown out” when computing <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\text{,}\)</span> the set of all linear combinations of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly independent, then no element of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the others; throwing any element out would thus result in <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\)</span> being strictly smaller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(\boldzero\in S\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent: indeed, we have the nontrivial linear combination <span class="process-math">\(1\boldzero=\boldzero\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(S=\{\boldv\}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly independent if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\ne \boldzero\text{.}\)</span> The previous comment shows why <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\ne \boldzero\)</span> is a necessary condition. Let's see why it is sufficient.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\ne\boldzero\text{,}\)</span> and suppose we have <span class="process-math">\(c\boldv=\boldzero\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html" title="Theorem 4.1.13: Basic vector space properties">Theorem 4.1.13</a> we have <span class="process-math">\(c=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\boldv=\boldzero\)</span> (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html" title="Theorem 4.1.13: Basic vector space properties">Theorem 4.1.13</a>). Since <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\ne 0\text{,}\)</span> we conclude <span class="process-math">\(c=0\text{.}\)</span> This shows that the only linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> yielding <span class="process-math">\(\boldzero\)</span> is the trivial one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(S=\{\boldv, \boldw\}\)</span> contains exactly two distinct elements. From the last remark, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly independent if and only if one of its elements is a scalar multiple of the other.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to decide whether a two-element set is linearly independent. Note however, that the same observation does not apply to larger sets: e.g., <span class="process-math">\(S=\{(1,1),(1,0), (0,1)\}\)</span> can be shown to be linearly dependent, and yet no element of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a scalar multiple of any other element.</p>
