<p>Now suppose there is more than one solution. Then there are at least two different solutions: \(P_1=(x_1,y_1)\) and \(P_2=(x_2,y_2)\text{.}\) Take any of the two lines \(\ell_i, \ell_j\text{.}\) By above the intersection of \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) contains \(P_1\) and \(P_2\text{.}\) But two <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">distinct</em> lines intersect in at most one point. It follows that \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) must be equal. Since \(\ell_i\) and \(\ell_j\) were arbitrary, it follows <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> of the lines \(\ell_i\) are in fact the same line \(\ell\text{.}\) But this means the common intersection of the lines is \(\ell\text{,}\) which has infinitely many points. It follows that the system has infinitely many solutions.</p>
