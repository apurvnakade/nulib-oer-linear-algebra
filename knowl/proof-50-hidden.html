<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>The proof amounts to the following observations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The zero function \(0_X\colon X\rightarrow \R\) is an element of all of these sets: i.e. the zero function is continuous, \(C^n\text{,}\) \(C^\infty\text{,}\) a polynomial, etc..</p></li>
<li><p>If \(f\) and \(g\) both satisfy one of these properties (continuous, \(C^n\text{,}\) \(C^\infty\text{,}\) polynomial, etc.), then so does \(cf+dg\) for any \(c,d\in \R\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">The second, “closed under linear combinations” observation is easily seen for \(P(X)\) and \(P_n(X)\) (i.e., the sum of two polynomials of degree at most \(n\) is clearly a polynomial of degree at most \(n\)); for the other spaces, this is a result of calculus properties to the effect that adding and scaling functions preserves continuity and differentiability.</p>
<p>Lastly, that each subset relation holds in the given chain follows from similar observations: polynomials are infinitely differentiable, differentiable functions are continuous, etc..</p></article></body>
