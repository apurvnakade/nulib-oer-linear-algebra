</h4>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is a subspace of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> then it <em class="emphasis">inherits</em> a vector space structure from <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> by simply  <em class="emphasis">restricting</em> the vector operations defined on <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to the subset <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>It is important to understand how conditions (ii)-(iii) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_subspace.html" title="Definition 3.3.1: Subspace">Definition 3.3.1</a> come into play here. Without them we would not be able to say that restricting the vector operations of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to elements of <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> actually gives rise to well-defined operations on <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> To be well-defined the operations must output elements that lie not just in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> but in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> itself. This is precisely what being closed under addition and scalar multiplication guarantees.</p>
<p>Once we know restriction gives rise to well-defined operations on <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> verifying the axioms of  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_vector_space.html" title="Definition 3.1.1: Vector space">Definition 3.1.1</a> mostly amounts to observing that if a condition is true for all <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> it is certainly true for all <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\)</span> in the subset <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The “existential axioms” (iii) and (iv) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_vector_space.html" title="Definition 3.1.1: Vector space">Definition 3.1.1</a>, however, require special consideration. By definition, a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> contains the zero vector of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> and clearly this still acts as the zero vector when we restrict the vector operations to <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> What about vector inverses? We know that for any <span class="process-math">\(\boldv\in W\)</span> there is a vector inverse <span class="process-math">\(-\boldv\)</span> lying somewhere in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We must show that in fact <span class="process-math">\(-\boldv\)</span> lies in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{:}\)</span> i.e. we need to show that the operation of taking the vector inverse is well-defined on <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> We prove this as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/d_vector_space.html ./knowl/d_subspace.html ./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html">
\begin{align*}
\boldv\in W \amp\implies (-1)\boldv\in W \amp (\knowl{./knowl/d_subspace.html}{\text{Definition 3.3.1}}, \text{(iii) } )\\
\amp\implies -\boldv\in W \amp (\knowl{./knowl/th_vectorspace_props.html}{\text{Theorem 3.1.13}}, (iii)) \text{.}
\end{align*}
